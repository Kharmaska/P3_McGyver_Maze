# Project n°3: MacGyver Maze
## Maze: help MacGyver escaping the maze
### 1. Purpose of the game:
<p>In this mini Python game, based on Pygame library, you will have to recover the 3 items inside the maze so MacGyver can build an awesome weapon to defeat the guardian and escape the maze.<br>
In case an item would be missing before facing the guardian, you lose!<p>
  
### 2. Specifications of the project:
This game was programmed during my OpenClassRooms Python degree course. As such, a frame was imposed while coding this exercise:
- [ ] There is only one level. The structure (start, location of the walls, finish line), must be saved in a file for easy modification if necessary.
- [ ] MacGyver will be controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard.
- [ ] The objects will be randomly distributed in the labyrinth and will change location if the user closes the game and restarts it.
- [ ] The game window will be a square that can display 15 sprites lengthwise.
- [ ] MacGyver will therefore have to move from square to square.
- [ ] He will pick-up an object simply by moving over it.
- [ ] The program stops only if MacGyver has recovered all the objects and has found the exit. If he does not have all the items and he gets to the guard, he dies (a hero's life...).
- [ ] The program is a standalone game that could run on any computer.
- [ ] The code needs to be compliant with PEP 8 recommendations
- [ ] Development of the program should be done in a Virtual Environment using Python 3.X
